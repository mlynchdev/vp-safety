1) Zero-tolerance policy
Vanity Plate strictly prohibits Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) and any Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). Any content that sexualizes or exploits minors is banned and will be removed and reported.

2) Who these standards apply to
All users, content, comments, usernames, messages, and images on Vanity Plate.

3) Prohibited content (non-exhaustive)
• Any sexual content involving minors (real or synthetic/AI-generated)
• Nudity or sexualized depiction of minors
• Solicitation, grooming, sextortion, or sexual comments directed at minors
• Links or instructions to obtain CSAM

4) Detection & enforcement
• User reports: In-app “Report” is available on every post/profile.
• Moderation: CSAM-related reports are triaged with highest priority. Confirmed content is immediately removed, accounts are suspended/banned, and evidence preserved as required by law.
• Repeated or egregious offenders are permanently banned, including device/account re-registration countermeasures.

5) Reporting to authorities
When we become aware of CSAM on our platform, we report it to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) via the CyberTipline and cooperate with law enforcement, consistent with applicable laws. Users can also report directly at https://report.cybertip.org/ if they encounter suspected exploitation.
We preserve and provide required information in line with legal obligations.

6) Safety-by-design
• No tolerance for child endangerment
• Clear community guidelines and swift removal
• Age-inappropriate features are restricted
• Ongoing policy and tooling improvements

7) Appeals
If your content/account was removed in error, contact support through the in-app appeal flow or email us. We do not restore content that violates these standards.
